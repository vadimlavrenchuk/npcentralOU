# 🚨 SECURITY INCIDENT - Credential Exposure Response

**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Severity:** HIGH

---

## 📋 Incident Summary

MongoDB credentials were accidentally committed to GitHub repository in file `ЗАДАЧА_ВЫПОЛНЕНА.md` (commit 2eca59ba).

**Exposed credentials:**
- Username: `vadimlavrenchuk`
- Password: `REDACTED_PASSWORD`
- Database: `MechanicPro`
- Cluster: `mechanicpro.wjylube.mongodb.net`

---

## ✅ Actions Taken

### 1. Removed from Git History
```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch 'ЗАДАЧА_ВЫПОЛНЕНА.md'" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push origin --force --all
```

**Result:** ✅ File completely removed from all commits

### 2. Verified Removal
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- "*ЗАДАЧА*"  # No results
git ls-files | grep "ЗАДАЧА"                # File not found
```

**Result:** ✅ File does not exist in repository history

## 🔒 REQUIRED: Change MongoDB Credentials

### Step 1: Login to MongoDB Atlas
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Login with your account

### Step 2: Change Database User Password

**Option A: Change Password (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to: Database Access → Users
2. Find user: `vadimlavrenchuk`
3. Click "Edit" → "Edit Password"
4. Generate new strong password
5. Update `backend/.env` with new credentials

**Option B: Delete & Create New User (Most Secure)**
1. Navigate to: Database Access → Users
2. Delete user: `vadimlavrenchuk`
3. Create new user with different name
4. Update `backend/.env` with new credentials

### Step 3: Update Application

**File:** `backend/.env`

```env
# OLD - COMPROMISED (DO NOT USE)
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://vadimlavrenchuk:REDACTED_PASSWORD@...

# NEW - Update with new credentials
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://NEW_USERNAME:NEW_PASSWORD@mechanicpro.wjylube.mongodb.net/MechanicPro?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=MechanicPro
```

### Step 4: Restart Application
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Verify Connection
Check console output:
```
✅ MongoDB Atlas connected successfully
🚀 Server is running on port 5000
```

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### Already Implemented ✅
1. `.env` files in `.gitignore`
2. `.env.example` template without real credentials
3. Documentation emphasizes security

### Additional Recommendations

#### 1. Use MongoDB IP Whitelist
- Go to Network Access in MongoDB Atlas
- Restrict access to specific IP addresses only
- Remove `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all) if present

#### 2. Enable Database Auditing
- Track all database access
- Monitor for suspicious activity

#### 3. Use Read-Only Users When Possible
- Create separate users for different access levels
- Grant minimum required permissions

#### 4. Rotate Credentials Regularly
- Change passwords every 90 days
- Use password manager to generate strong passwords

#### 5. Pre-Commit Hooks
Install git-secrets or similar tools:
```bash
npm install --save-dev git-secrets
```

#### 6. GitHub Secret Scanning
- Already enabled (that's how we found this issue!)
- Review alerts regularly

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### What Was Exposed
- ✅ MongoDB connection string with username/password
- ✅ Database name and cluster location

### What Was NOT Exposed
- ✅ Firebase API keys (properly in .env)
- ✅ JWT secrets (properly in .env)
- ✅ Other environment variables

### Potential Impact
- **Low Risk** if password changed immediately
- **High Risk** if unchanged - anyone could access database

### Who Had Access
- GitHub repository was public during exposure
- Unknown number of external viewers
- Automated scanners detected it

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] File removed from Git history
- [x] Force push completed to GitHub
- [x] Verified file no longer in repository
- [ ] **MongoDB password changed** ← YOU NEED TO DO THIS NOW!
- [ ] Application restarted with new credentials
- [ ] Database access verified
- [ ] IP whitelist configured (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Monitoring enabled for suspicious activity

4. Install pre-commit hooks

### LONG TERM (This Month)
1. Implement secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)
2. Regular security audits
3. Team training on credential security
4. Automated credential rotation
